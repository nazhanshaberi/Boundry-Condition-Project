The problem given is an industrial cooling system is used to provide cold air within the working area. A typical design of a cooling duct is of rectangular shape. As illustrated in Figure 1, the cross section of the cooling duct pass through a brick wall is shown. The temperature distribution of the brick wall measuring 7 units by 7 units is governed by:

𝜕2𝑇/𝜕𝑥+𝜕2𝑇/𝜕𝑦=0

Individual students are assigned to different geometric parameters. The spacing a, b, c and d are different from each student. For mine, 𝑎=3 𝑏=2 𝑐=4 𝑑=2
